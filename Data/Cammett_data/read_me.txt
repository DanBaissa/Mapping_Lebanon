MC notes on shapefiles from Sukriti, November 2, 2009

National includes all zones (1644)
Voter include approx. 1580 zones for which we have data on registered voters
These files are projected, and were revised to be usable after they were received (in poor shape) from Statistics Lebanon
The national and voter files lack the updated institutions (i.e., changing the Hezbollah institution in Mjadel from Jezzine to Sour).  I also need to check whether they have the cluster variables that Jing created.
